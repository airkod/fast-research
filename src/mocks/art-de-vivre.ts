Within this region, you'll find towering European Beech and Silver Fir trees that dominate the landscape, along with a diverse range of wildlife, including wolves and bears, giving it an otherworldly, even eerie ambiance, particularly during foggy days. It's worth noting that this is the very land associated with the legend of Dracula.

3. South Africa: Climbing the Table MountainSouth Africa, home to some of the world's most famous and exhilarating wildlife, including elephants, lions, zebras, and rhinos, as well as vast and stunning savannahs and the iconic Table Mountain, beckons adventurers. Its breathtaking landscapes are unmatched, boasting an impressive array of natural wonders.

 A must-do activity in South Africa is the half-day hike up the 3,500-foot-tall Table Mountain in Cape Town. From the cliff tops, you'll gaze upon the lush blue sea, reflecting the sun's brilliance, while the rugged green terrain and passing white clouds create a truly unparalleled hiking backdrop. If you want to skip the three to five-hour hike however, the ascent by cable car to the summit bestows incredible panoramic views through its 360-degree glass walls.
Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden, nestled on the eastern slopes of Table Mountain, is an oasis teeming with rare proteas, the nation's emblematic flower. From November to April, these gardens transform into an unmissable spectacle, hosting South African and international music performances every Sunday as the sun sets. Table Mountain  AdobeStock
 If youre looking for extraordinary accommodation, the Future Found Sanctuary in Hout Bay is out-of-this world. Jim Brett, who worked for brands like Anthropologie and West Elm, acquired an ancestral family home on the slopes of Table Mountain in 2014 and later opened it to the public. The gardens surrounding it were landscaped by Cherise Viljoen, horticulturist and nursery manager at Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden. The hotel offers an appealing wellness experience, encompassing everything from cuisine to fitness. Part of the thrill of staying here is also just ambling through the grounds beneath the shade of frangipani trees, or you can go for a swim in the pool.
For those yearning for further adventures, embarking on an African safari to behold the mesmerising wildlife that has enthralled the world is a compelling choice. South Africa provides an inexhaustible wealth of attractions and experiences for all lovers of nature.
4. Japan: Nara Park
Japan, known as the land of the rising sun, not only boasts magnificent traditional architecture, including temples and shrines but also showcases the astounding wonders of the natural world.
Of course, Mount Fuji, with its 5 to 10-hour hiking trail, ranks among the world's most renowned hiking routes, while Japan's numerous islands and mountains make it one of Asia's most visually captivating nature destinations.
 Nara, Japan  Bruce Tang
 A half-day hike through Nara Park, where you can interact with friendly deer as they roam freely, also offers a delightful experience. The park is adorned with exquisite cherry blossom trees that burst into vibrant pink blooms during the spring season, creating a tranquil backdrop for mindful and meditative walks.
In the year 710, the first permanent Japanese capital was established in Nara. But after only 74 years, the capital was relocated to Nagaoka and shortly afterward to Kyoto. The city of Nara was designed in a rectangular grid pattern, inspired by Chinese principles. Nara became the political and cultural hub, featuring numerous temples, pagodas, and palaces. Head to Mount Wakakusa for a hike to the 342-metre-high summit, which during Spring is famous for viewing cherry blossoms.
5. Morocco: Crossing the Sahara
Morocco might surprise many, as it may not be immediately associated with a stunning natural paradise due to its predominantly desert landscapes. However, deserts possess their unique charm and beauty, and Morocco unveils this allure for those who may have doubts. To truly appreciate the enchantment and spectacle of the Sahara Desert, there's no better way than embarking on a Moroccan desert tour.

 Crossing the vast Sahara aboard camels, with the scorching sun overhead and undulating sand dunes interrupting the flat expanse, presents a remarkable daytime experience. But as the sun sets, the golden sands transform into a vibrant dark orange, setting the stage for an unforgettable night. Camping in the desert and gazing at the night sky reveals one of the world's clearest and most breathtaking celestial displays. It's a life-changing experience that every nature enthusiast should not miss. For some comfort and a good nights sleep after exploring, make sure you book well advance: The Desert Luxury Camp in Merzouga, 360 km from the Uarzazate International Airport, features large and cosy traditional tents with king size beds, beautiful rugs and moroccan furniture, a private bathroom, a terrace and restaurant.

 Venturing out for an adventurous journey is a truly exceptional way to discover something new. Even if you wouldn't typically engage in hiking or nature activities in your daily routine, taking a step outside your comfort zone during a vacation can be rejuvenating. All too often, we return from holidays feeling drained when, instead, we could return refreshed and invigorated by connecting with nature.
